Setting Up Expo Go on a Physical Device
Prerequisites

Node.js LTS (latest long-term support version)

Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

A compatible operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)

Why Expo Go?

Unlike traditional web development, mobile development typically requires device emulators to test applications. Running these emulators can demand high hardware resources, especially with the wide variety of devices available (e.g., iPhone 7 â†’ iPhone 16 Pro Max, different Android models).

Expo Go provides a cost-effective solution by enabling you to test and run React Native applications directly on your physical device. It supports both Android and iOS seamlessly, avoiding the need for expensive emulators.
